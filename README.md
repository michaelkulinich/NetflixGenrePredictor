Noah Ferrel, Raha Pirzadeh, Michael Kulinich

## Description
Netflix has been the go-to streaming service for movies
and TV shows since launching in the 2010s. By having
a recommendation system tailored to each of their users,
Netflix’s algorithm picks films and shows based on similarity
and other users’ votes. For this project, we created a TV Show / Movie genre predictor from the plot description using Natural Language processing.
